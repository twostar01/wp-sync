PROMPT="I'm working on the '$PROJECT' project and want to add an entry to BUILDLOG.md.

Date: $DATE

Commits since last entry:
${COMMITS}

Files changed:
${STAT}

Ask me a few focused questions to understand the key decisions, what I tried, and what someone building a similar project should know. Then draft a BUILDLOG.md entry in this format:

## ${DATE} — [brief title]

[One or more narrative paragraphs — conversational, practical, written for a builder trying to replicate or learn from this project. Capture the why behind decisions, not just what changed.]

Keep it readable, not a changelog. Aim for the style of a builder's project log — what worked, what didn't, and why you made the calls you did."
